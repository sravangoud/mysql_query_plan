 * Not able to write to the .frm( form file)...
 *  Is it a constraint???? or insufficient data????
 *
 *
 * Why do we need to create .frm file????
 * Can't we manage it inside handler implementation(custom storage engine)????
 *		-	no...some piece of the native handler code looks for .frm file
 *		before passing the handle to custom handler.
